# online-journal

This is an online journal for my CS50 final project, based on the CS50 Finance assignment. This utilises Flask as a back-end (micro)framework, and sqlite3 for managing the databases containing user accounts and their entries. This allows users to register for an account, login, see their previous entries ordered reverse chronologically, and write new entries in a ckeditor WYSIWYG rich text editor.

## Features
- Registration system
- Alerts for if username taken/form validation
- Write entries and view log of previous entries
- Delete account feature
